# Clustering-Analysis-With-K-Means
<p> A telecommunications company is trying to develop a better understanding of their customers. They want to know why their customers are churning and how they can develop a better relationship with these customers. To analyze this, the question: What key attributes impact churned customers the most? will be answered. To answer and analyze the research question posed, a clustering technique called K-Means will be performed. Clustering is the collection of data points that are aggregated together due to their similarities. The goal of this analysis will be to determine two to three key attributes that are impactful to the customer churning from the company. Once these variables are identified, new marketing campaigns and target products can be developed to retain future customers with similar attributes. </p>
